          <p>
            I'm a community-taught web developer from Toronto, Canada ü¶ù üá®üá¶ .
            I've focused on building a solid foundation to be a front-end
            developer. I'm well versed in HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, and
            React.js. Recently I've also been working with PostgreSQL, GraphQL,
            and Next.js, to build faster and better web applications. You can
            always view my latest work in the repos below.
          </p>
          <RepoCarousel repos={repos} />
          <p>
            Before the Covid-19 epidemic, I was working in the hospitality
            industry in Toronto. As work became scarce, I started to think about
            a career change. So I started to teach myself to code. Through
            resources like Codecademy and a number of online tutorials from
            awesome creators like Jason Lengstorf, Kent C. Dodds, Ali Spittel,
            Emma Bostian, Jhey Dev and many others, I found my love for
            programming. My goal is to help make the tech community and the web
            as a whole, even more accessible. I'd love to help others learn to
            code and break into the tech industry. I aim to reach a spot where I
            can give back a little of what I've gained from the dev community
            and help people grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the moment I'm looking for a fulltime frontend development role.
            I want to continue to grow my skill set, working in a team
            environment. If you'd like to get in touch about an opportunity,
            please feel free to reach out. I love to talk!{" "}
